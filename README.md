# TextDetection
Tesseract is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google that can be used for text detection and recognition tasks. Tesseract supports various input image formats including TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

To perform text detection using Tesseract, you can follow these steps:

1.Install Tesseract on your system. You can download Tesseract from the official GitHub repository.

2.Load the input image using a suitable library like OpenCV or Pillow.

3.Preprocess the image to improve the quality of the input. Common preprocessing steps include resizing, blurring, thresholding, and binarization.

4.Apply the Tesseract OCR engine to the preprocessed image to extract the text. You can use the pytesseract library to call Tesseract from Python.

5.Post-process the extracted text to remove unwanted characters, spaces, and newlines.

6.Finally, use the extracted text for further analysis or output it to a file or database.
